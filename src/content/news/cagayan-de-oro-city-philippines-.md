The event, titled “USTP CodeFest 2026,” was held at the university’s main campus in Cagayan de Oro and spanned over two days. Participants were challenged to develop creative digital solutions addressing real-world problems such as disaster response, education accessibility, and local business support.

More than 20 teams competed in the hackathon, working around the clock to design, build, and present their projects. The atmosphere was filled with excitement and collaboration as students exchanged ideas, debugged code, and refined their prototypes under tight deadlines.

According to event organizer Engr. Maria Santos, the hackathon aimed to “encourage innovation, teamwork, and practical application of technical skills among students.” Industry mentors were also present during the event, providing guidance and feedback to participants throughout the development process.

Among the standout projects was a mobile application designed to assist small local vendors in managing inventory and digital payments, earning the top prize for its practicality and user-friendly design.

Judging criteria included innovation, technical complexity, usability, and overall impact. Winners received cash prizes, certificates, and potential internship opportunities with partner tech companies.

Students expressed their enthusiasm for the event, highlighting the valuable experience gained. “It pushed us beyond our limits and helped us apply what we’ve learned in class to real-life scenarios,” said one participant.

The success of CodeFest 2026 marks another milestone for USTP in promoting technology-driven education and student innovation. The university plans to make the hackathon an annual event, further strengthening its commitment to developing future-ready graduates.
