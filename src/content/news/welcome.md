Welcome to the new official website of the **Society of Information Technology Enthusiasts (SITE)**! This platform was built to serve as a centralized hub for all BSIT students.

## What's New?

* **Digital Resource Hub**: Access syllabi and guides easily.
* **Transparency Dashboard**: View financial reports and meeting minutes.
* **Events Calendar**: Stay updated with our latest workshops.

We built this using **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS** to ensure speed and accessibility. Feel free to explore and let us know what you think!
